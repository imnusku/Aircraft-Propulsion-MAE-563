# Aircraft-Propulsion-MAE-563
Propulsion System Analysis Tool

 This project aims to analyze ramjet and scramjet engines using a MATLAB-based parametric tool. The
 tool models non-ideal flow conditions for engines with a fixed-geometry converging-only nozzle, enabling
 systematic variation of input parameters such as flight altitude, Mach number, diffuser and nozzle efficiencies,
 and combustor temperature limits.
